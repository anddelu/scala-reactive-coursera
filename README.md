Principles of Reactive Programming
==================================

I took the online Principles of Reactive Programming in Scala course (https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive) taught by Martin Odersky, Erik Meijer and Roland Kuhn from Nov 2013 - Jan 2014.

This repository contains my solutions to all the programming exercises.

(Note that this repository was created 8 months after the course had completed so as not to violate the honour code.)
